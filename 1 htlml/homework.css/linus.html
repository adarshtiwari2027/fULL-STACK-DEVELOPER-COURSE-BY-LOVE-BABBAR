      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <pre>
    <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
   Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the 28th December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,[6] the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. 
   His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. 
   His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, 
   "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize–winning chemist and half blanket-carrying cartoon character".[7]
   His interest in computers began with a VIC-20[8] at the age of 11 in 1981. He started programming for it in BASIC, then later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (he did not utilize assembly language).[9]
